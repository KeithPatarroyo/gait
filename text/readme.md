# Text Summarization Experiment
This directory contains code to replicate the final figure of section 4.1, on text summarization.
To run this code, please first download the 300-dimensional word vectors from https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/fasttext/vectors-english/wiki-news-300d-1M-subword.vec.zip,
and the parallel news corpus from http://www.casmacat.eu/corpus/news-commentary/txt.tgz,
and place both in the directory ./data/ (unzipping as necessary).

With this done, run the scripts in this directory numbered 1-6 in order.
The figures used in the paper will be saved as cloud_1.pdf, cloud_1_tfidf.pdf and cloud_1_tfidf_top_31.pdf
